# Web3Winner Project Overview

Welcome to the Web3Winner project! This is an innovative blockchain-based application designed to create an engaging experience for users, offering them the opportunity to win exciting prizes through smart contracts. The frontend of this project is built using the Vite framework along with the styling provided by Tailwind CSS, while the underlying smart contracts are developed using the Hardhat framework.

## Features

- Users can participate in specific activities, purchase tickets, or perform designated actions to enter and increase their chances of winning valuable prizes.
- The project ensures transparency and verifiability through the utilization of smart contracts, providing a trustless environment for participants.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** The project's frontend is structured using the Vite framework, allowing for rapid development and efficient module management.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is employed to streamline the styling process, offering a utility-first approach that simplifies customization and design.
- **Smart Contract Implementation:** The project integrates the Hardhat framework for developing and testing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. Hardhat's flexibility and robust toolset make contract development and deployment straightforward.
